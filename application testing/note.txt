# Application testing
-> python's user-friendly syntax and readability makes it an excellent choice for QA testers of all skill levels
-> its straightforward structure and clear code organization facilitates rapid prototyping and implementation of test scripts
-> libraries like playwright and selenium are great option
-> for web applications, QA engineers write test script that load the application in a headless browser, normally a QA or test
    environment and perform a series of validations to determine that the application is correctly working
-> for example, if you want to test a user's list page, you can load the page, and querying DOM elements, you can validate that
    effectively the app is rendering results. Even more so you can simulate keyboard strokes, clicks, complete forms and much
    more with these tools
